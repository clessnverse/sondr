\title{Find Quantile Range for a Given Value}
\usage{
find_quantile_range(x, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric value for which the quantile range is to be found.}

\item{vector}{A numeric vector representing the data within which to find the quantiles.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of two elements where the first element is the lower bound of the quantile
        range (inclusive) and the second element is the upper bound of the quantile range (inclusive).
        The quantile bounds are returned as percentages (e.g., 0.20 for 20th percentile).
}
\description{
This function calculates the range of quantiles that a given value covers in a specified vector.
It determines the lowest and highest quantiles within which the value falls.
The quantiles are computed based on the percentiles from 0% to 100%.
}
\examples{
# Generate a random dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- runif(100, min = 0, max = 1000)

# Find the quantile range for the value 300
find_quantile_range(300, data)

# Find the quantile range for the value 134
find_quantile_range(134, data)

}
